Hey ðŸ‘‹

I'm Abdelilah, a 19-year-old full-stack coding student at 01Talents Morocco.
Before diving into coding, I was a security researcher at Intigriti, where i found and reported serious web app vulnerabilities which sharpened my cybersecurity skills.

Now, Iâ€™m focused on building cool projects and solving real-world problems ðŸš€.

Iâ€™m passionate about coding, cybersecurity, entrepreneurship, and SaaS.

Hobbies
Outside of tech, I love swimmingâ€”Iâ€™ve even completed a 2 km swim non-stop :)
