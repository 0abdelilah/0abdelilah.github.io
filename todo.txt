Hey ðŸ‘‹

I'm Abdelilah, a 20-year-old full-stack coding student at 01Talents Morocco. Before diving into coding at 01Talents, I was a Cybersecurity researcher which lead to me finding some serious vulnerabilities, but now I'm all about coding and innovation! ðŸš€


I'm really passionate about about Coding, Cybersecurity, Entrepreneurship and SaaS
